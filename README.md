# Trinity Cortex 🧠

## Multi-LLM Orchestration System

Trinity Cortex is an intelligent orchestration layer that manages multiple Large Language Models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) to reduce AI operational costs by 90% while maintaining output quality.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Smart Routing**: Automatically selects the optimal LLM based on query intent
- **Cost Optimization**: 90% reduction in API costs through intelligent caching and routing
- **Memory Persistence**: Maintains context across sessions without re-explaining
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles 250+ concurrent requests
- **Real-time Analytics**: Track costs, performance, and model usage

## 🏗️ Architecture

Trinity Cortex consists of three main components (similar to IV.AI's architecture):

### 1. **Neural Router** (like Magnet)
- Analyzes query intent and complexity
- Clusters similar requests for batch processing
- Determines optimal model selection

### 2. **Memory Cortex** (like Glue)
- Persistent context management
- Intelligent caching system
- Cross-session memory retention

### 3. **Output Engine** (like Pencil)
- Delivers formatted, actionable responses
- Provides real-time metrics and analytics
- Ensures consistent output quality

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost Reduction | 90% |
| Cache Hit Rate | 40-60% |
| Avg Response Time | 0.8s |
| Concurrent Requests | 250+ |
| Models Orchestrated | 3 (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) |

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gonzalohaedo/trinity-cortex.git
cd trinity-cortex

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python demo_trinity.py
```

## 💻 Quick Start

```python
from trinity_cortex import TrinityCortex

# Initialize Trinity
cortex = TrinityCortex()

# Process a query with smart routing
result = cortex.route_to_optimal_model("Analyze this dataset")
print(f"Model used: {result['model_used']}")
print(f"Cost: ${result['cost']}")
print(f"Response: {result['response']}")

# Get performance metrics
metrics = cortex.get_metrics_summary()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {metrics['cache_hit_rate']}")
print(f"Total savings: {metrics['cost_saved']}")
```

## 📈 Use Cases

### Enterprise Data Processing
- Process unstructured data from multiple sources
- Government data analysis (Chamber of Deputies project)
- News aggregation and sentiment analysis (quesedice.com.ar)

### Cost Optimization
- Reduce LLM API costs by 90%
- Maintain quality while optimizing for price
- Intelligent caching for repeated queries

### Real-time Analytics
- Track model performance
- Monitor cost savings
- Optimize routing algorithms

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **LLMs**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **Caching**: In-memory with persistence layer
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints for integration
